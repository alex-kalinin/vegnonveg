-- finetune the model. The steps involved are defined below.
     - pre-req : Define inception_v1 model in BigDL and load it with Caffe model's weights
     - remove the last layer of the model)
     - freeze all the layers
     - add a new layer with 'num_class' we have in our data-set
     - compile the model

-- train the fine-tuned model on custome dataset

-- evaluate the performance of the model
